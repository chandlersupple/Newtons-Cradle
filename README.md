# Newton's Cradle
Abstract:
A simulation of Newton's Cradle in a vacuum environment, devoid of gravity and friction.

Running Environment:
The code, which was developed in Python 2.7.14, is compatible with Python 2.7, or 3 variants. Without an IDE downloaded, I recommend running the simulation in Repl.it, or a Jupyter Notebook, both of which are online, and operate in browser. 

Controls: 
To release the ball, of which can be moved along the horizontal axis, press the 'space' bar. 
The simulation will continue until the user presses 's'. When the simulation has been stopped, the ball can be reset, and released again.
